### Seattle Collisions Practice
This <a href='https://noah-rarick.github.io/seattle-collision-practice/'>web map</a> is a practice area for smart dashboard development using c3.js and Mapbox.

I chose to use a proportional circle map, displaying variance of size and color based on the number of injuries a collision had. I did this as it easily communicates to the reader the severity of each collision through two visual methods.

I then used the mapBounds function to query the extent of collisions in the map, using these points to create a collisions KPI and injuries chart.
